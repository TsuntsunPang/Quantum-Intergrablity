## The Hamitonian for XXX model with spin 1/2 is given by 
$$H=J\sum_{n=1}^{N}\vec{S}_n \cdot \vec{S}_{n+1}$$
##  where $S_n$ is spin operator at site $n$. And $J$ is copling constant. $J<0$ represents antiferromagnetism while $J>0$ represents ferromagnetism.  We introduce raise and lower operators
